001 [SDH Paper-title] Silicon Stratigraphy: A Provenance-First Framework for Preserving Pre-LLM Digital Artifacts in Archaeological and Cultural Heritage Contexts

002 [Normal] SCOTT J. BOUDREAUX, Elyan Labs, Louisiana, USA

003 [SDH Body Text] Digital archaeology now faces a practical preservation problem: how to retain high-confidence human digital records as machine-generated media rapidly expands. This paper proposes a provenance-first framework, Silicon Stratigraphy, for preserving pre-LLM web and software artifacts while documenting post-LLM transformations. The framework combines established digital preservation standards (OAIS, Memento, PROV-O) with cryptographic timestamping and hardware-attested archival workflows. A live implementation is presented as a case study: RustChain Proof of Antiquity nodes and offline legacy compute environments used to capture, hash, timestamp, and replicate artifacts before and after synthetic augmentation. The contribution is methodological rather than universalizing: a reproducible protocol for separating source strata, recording transformation lineage, and reducing evidentiary ambiguity in future scholarship. The framework was developed through hands-on systems operations, repeated validation cycles, and preservation work on mixed legacy and modern infrastructure. The paper closes with validation criteria, governance risks, and recommendations for community-scale deployment in archaeology-adjacent digital heritage work.

009 [SDH Title 1] INTRODUCTION

010 [SDH Body Text] Archaeology increasingly depends on digital evidence: web pages, repositories, discussion archives, and born-digital field documentation. At the same time, generative systems now produce large volumes of plausible text, images, and code. The resulting challenge is not only long-term storage but evidentiary trust: whether future researchers can distinguish original artifacts from later synthetic revisions, summaries, or reconstructions.

011 [SDH Body Text] This paper addresses that challenge through a pragmatic question: how can digital heritage practitioners preserve pre-LLM artifacts and document post-LLM interventions without losing chain-of-custody clarity? Rather than treating AI as intrinsically harmful or beneficial, the paper frames it as a provenance pressure that requires better capture and attribution methods at the exact point where data are collected, transformed, and published.

012 [SDH Body Text] The main contribution is a preservation framework called Silicon Stratigraphy. The framework adapts archaeological stratigraphic logic to digital corpora: (1) isolate temporal layers of artifact production, (2) preserve low-level evidence for each layer, and (3) register transformations with explicit lineage metadata. A field implementation is reported using a live attested ledger (RustChain), web snapshot capture, and offline legacy compute environments.

013 [SDH Title 1] BACKGROUND AND RELATED STANDARDS

014 [SDH Body Text] The framework builds on existing preservation and provenance standards rather than replacing them. The goal is interoperability with existing archaeological digital practice, not a parallel process.

015 [SDH Title 2] OAIS Model

016 [SDH Body Text] The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) remains the reference architecture for ingest, archival storage, data management, and dissemination in long-term digital preservation (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems 2012). It establishes functional vocabulary and responsibilities for trustworthy repositories.

017 [SDH Title 2] Memento Protocol

018 [SDH Body Text] RFC 7089 defines datetime content negotiation for web archives, enabling time-based retrieval and citation of prior web states (Van de Sompel et al. 2013). This is central for reconstructing pre-LLM web context.

019 [SDH Title 2] PROV-O

020 [SDH Body Text] W3C PROV-O provides an ontology for describing entities, activities, and agents in provenance graphs (Lebo, Sahoo, and McGuinness 2013). It is suitable for recording synthetic and non-synthetic transformation chains.

021 [SDH Title 2] AI Governance Context

022 [SDH Body Text] UNESCO and NIST frameworks emphasize transparency, accountability, and risk management for AI systems (UNESCO 2021; National Institute of Standards and Technology 2023). In heritage contexts, these principles imply explicit labeling and governance of machine-generated derivatives.

023 [SDH Title 1] SILICON STRATIGRAPHY FRAMEWORK

024 [SDH Title 2] Core Premise

025 [SDH Body Text] In stratigraphic archaeology, layer boundaries and disturbance events are key to interpretation. Silicon Stratigraphy adopts the same logic for digital corpora: interpretive confidence depends on preserving layer boundaries and documenting disturbances.

026 [SDH Title 2] Layer Taxonomy

027 [SDH Body Text] The taxonomy is intentionally operational, field-usable, and adjustable by project:

028 [SDH Body Text] 1. Analog Bedrock: paper records, magnetic media, and non-networked digital artifacts.

029 [SDH Body Text] 2. Early Network Layer: BBS/forum/web artifacts with low automation and identifiable human authorship patterns.

030 [SDH Body Text] 3. Pre-LLM Web Layer (baseline in this study: through 2022): high-volume human-authored web and open-source materials before broad public LLM deployment.

031 [SDH Body Text] 4. Synthetic Expansion Layer (2023-present): artifacts produced or transformed with generative systems.

032 [SDH Body Text] The boundary year (2022/2023) is configurable and should be justified per corpus.

033 [SDH Title 2] Preservation Invariants

034 [SDH Body Text] Each artifact is preserved with five invariants:

035 [SDH Body Text] 1. Byte-level object: original file or capture bundle.

036 [SDH Body Text] 2. Fixity: SHA-256 digest.

037 [SDH Body Text] 3. Time anchor: immutable timestamp entry.

038 [SDH Body Text] 4. Execution context: hardware/software environment metadata.

039 [SDH Body Text] 5. Lineage record: machine-readable transformation graph.

040 [SDH Title 2] Pipeline

041 [SDH Body Text] The capture and verification protocol follows six stages:

042 [SDH Body Text] Acquire: capture web/resource snapshots with full context metadata (URL, datetime, headers, toolchain).

043 [SDH Body Text] Fixity: compute SHA-256 and perform size/MIME checks before any derivative generation.

044 [SDH Body Text] Anchor: write digest plus metadata pointer to an attested ledger event.

045 [SDH Body Text] Replicate: store in at least two independent repositories (online plus offline).

046 [SDH Body Text] Transform: for every generated derivative, record model/tool/prompt/version and parent hash.

047 [SDH Body Text] Audit: run scheduled fixity and retrievability checks with exception logging and remediation notes.

048 [SDH Title 1] CASE STUDY: LIVE IMPLEMENTATION

049 [SDH Title 2] Infrastructure

050 [SDH Body Text] A working implementation was evaluated in an operational environment at Elyan Labs. The system includes: (1) a lightweight ledger (RustChain) for timestamp anchoring and audit events; (2) legacy and modern nodes (including PowerPC, POWER8, Apple Silicon, and x86) used for diversity of execution contexts; and (3) offline archival snapshots for selected web corpora. The implementation emphasis is practical reproducibility under mixed hardware constraints, not benchmark optimization.

051 [SDH Body Text] At the time of observation (February 11, 2026), live node telemetry exposed active miner enrollment and epoch data through public API endpoints. These values are reported here as environment state, not as universal performance claims.

052 [SDH Title 2] Why Hardware-Attested Contexts Were Included

053 [SDH Body Text] Digital forensics and emulation studies show that execution context affects reproducibility and interpretation (Digital Preservation Coalition n.d.). In this implementation, legacy hardware was used for two reasons: (1) to document historically plausible runtime constraints for replay and emulation; and (2) to diversify provenance evidence (clock sources, architecture, toolchain behavior) in signed archival events. The method does not claim that old hardware is inherently more truthful. The claim is narrower: explicit environment diversity improves auditability when recorded correctly and repeatedly validated.

054 [SDH Title 2] Applied Example Workflow

055 [SDH Body Text] A representative workflow for a pre-LLM webpage proceeds as follows:

056 [SDH Body Text] 1. Retrieve a dated snapshot (or capture a new one with full headers and timestamp).

057 [SDH Body Text] 2. Store capture bundle and compute SHA-256 digest.

058 [SDH Body Text] 3. Publish digest and metadata pointer to the attested ledger.

059 [SDH Body Text] 4. Generate derivative summaries or modernized renderings as separate artifacts.

060 [SDH Body Text] 5. Link each derivative to its parent hash with transformation metadata.

061 [SDH Body Text] This keeps interpretive products useful while preventing them from silently replacing source evidence. In this workflow, derivative outputs are never treated as substitutes for source-layer records.

064 [SDH Title 1] EVALUATION CRITERIA

065 [SDH Body Text] This work is a methods paper; evaluation is therefore procedural. A deployment is considered successful when it meets the following criteria and allows an external team to reconstruct the evidence path end-to-end:

066 [SDH Body Text] 1. Recoverability: independent parties can retrieve the preserved object from at least one replica.

067 [SDH Body Text] 2. Fixity integrity: periodic hash checks produce no unexplained drift.

068 [SDH Body Text] 3. Lineage completeness: each derivative has explicit parent links and transformation metadata.

069 [SDH Body Text] 4. Temporal auditability: timestamp anchors and capture datetimes are consistent and externally inspectable.

070 [SDH Body Text] 5. Disclosure quality: interfaces clearly distinguish source artifacts from generated derivatives.

071 [SDH Body Text] Future work should benchmark this framework against institutional repositories with controlled inter-rater studies on evidentiary confidence and blinded replication tasks.

072 [SDH Title 1] LIMITATIONS

073 [SDH Body Text] The current implementation has several limitations:

074 [SDH Body Text] 1. Single-organization deployment bias: field observations are from one operator context.

075 [SDH Body Text] 2. No adversarial red-team trial in this paper: tampering and replay resistance require separate formal testing.

076 [SDH Body Text] 3. Boundary ambiguity: some 2022-2024 artifacts are hybrid human/machine products, making strict layer assignment difficult.

077 [SDH Body Text] 4. Governance overhead: detailed provenance capture increases operational cost and may reduce adoption without tooling support.

078 [SDH Body Text] 5. Case-study depth: this manuscript focuses on method and implementation; larger multi-site comparative studies remain future work.

079 [SDH Title 1] GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS

080 [SDH Body Text] Preservation systems can reproduce power asymmetries if access and authorship controls are opaque. Three governance rules are recommended: (1) publish provenance schemas and audit procedures openly; (2) require explicit labeling for generated derivatives in public interfaces; and (3) support community co-curation to reduce unilateral control of archival narratives. These rules align with AI ethics guidance emphasizing transparency, accountability, and contestability (UNESCO 2021; National Institute of Standards and Technology 2023).

081 [SDH Title 1] CONCLUSION

082 [SDH Body Text] The core risk in post-LLM digital archaeology is not generation itself but undocumented transformation. Silicon Stratigraphy offers a practical response: preserve source layers, anchor fixity, and make derivative lineage explicit. The case study demonstrates that a small organization can implement this approach with existing standards and modest infrastructure and constrained operational conditions.

083 [SDH Body Text] For archaeology and digital heritage communities, the immediate priority is methodological convergence: interoperable provenance records, shared audit practices, and clear public labeling. If these controls are adopted early, synthetic tools can enrich interpretation without eroding the evidentiary substrate that future scholarship depends on.

084 [SDH Title 1] COMPETING INTERESTS

085 [SDH Body Text] The author leads projects discussed in the case study (RustChain and related infrastructure). This paper is presented as a methods and implementation note; readers should interpret platform-specific observations accordingly.

086 [SDH Title 1] DATA AND MATERIALS AVAILABILITY

087 [SDH Body Text] Example implementation artifacts are publicly visible in project repositories and live service endpoints at the time of writing. For archival integrity, timestamps and values should be re-queried by reviewers at evaluation time.
